      "# Collecting Twitter data from the API using Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Today we're going to focus on collecting Twitter data using their API using Python. You can use another language to collect data but Python makes it rather straightforward without having to know many other details about the API.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Using APIs\n",
      "\n",
      "The way that researchers and other people who want to get large publically available Twitter datasets is through their API. API stands for Application Programming Interface and many services that want to start a developer community around their product usually releases one. Facebook has an API that is somewhat restrictive, while Klout has an API to let you automatically look up Klout scores and all their different facets.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, here are a list of different APIs of different services:\n",

      "Facebook - [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/)\n",

      "## Accessing the Twitter API\n",
      "\n",
      "The Twitter API has two different flavors: RESTful and Streaming. The RESTful API is useful for getting things like lists of followers and those who follow a particular user, and is what most Twitter clients are built off of. We are not going to deal with the RESTful API right now, but you can find more information on it here: [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api]( https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api). Right now we are going to focus on the Streaming API (more info here: [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api)). The Streaming API works by making a request for a specific type of data \u2014 filtered by keyword, user, geographic area, or a random sample \u2014 and then keeping the connection open as long as there are no errors in the connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understanding Twitter Data\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you\u2019ve connected to the Twitter API, whether via the RESTful API or the Streaming API, you\u2019re going to start getting a bunch of data back.  The data you get back will be encoded in JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a way to encode complicated information in a platform-independent way.  It could be considered the lingua franca of information exchange on the Internet.  When you click a snazzy Web 2.0 button on Facebook or Amazon and the page produces a lightbox (a box that hovers above a page without leaving the page you\u2019re on now), there was probably some JSON involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "JSON is a rather simplistic and elegant way to encode complex data structures. When a tweet comes back from the API, this is what it looks like (with a little bit of beautifying):"
